	Web Application 

Core Java (J2SE/JavaSE/JSE)

Java Standard Edition : Standalone application or desktop application 

J2EE/JavaEE/JEE : Java Enterprise Edition : It is mainly use to develop web application. 

3 modues : Servlet /JSP(Java Server Pages)/EJB (Enterprise Java Bean)

	Unix : CURL 
	https://www.google.com ---> URL----> GUI (Browser)	

		req(http/https)------------>

Client 					Server 
		<--------res(http/https)----------

	http: Hypertext transfer protocol. 
	www: world wide web 
	google : domain 
	com : commerical 

					HTML/HTML5
					CSS/CSS3
					JavaScript :
					JavaScript was mainly use to do validaion on 
					client side. 

					WE can do validation nowadays using 
					JavaScript or HTML5 features. 

					JEE : Servlet/JSP/EJB 
					Spring boot 
				
					Asp.net : asp/c#

					Php 

					CGI 

					Python 

					Node JS(Using JavaScript)
						
	Server :
		2 types 
	1. Web Server :
	2. Application Server :				
			war file 
	Container : It is a part of server which also known as engine. It is responsible to execute servlet,jsp and ejb 
	programs. In Servlet,JSP and EJB no main method. Here container load the class, create the objects, 
	call the life cycle methods and destroy those object if no client calling that application. 

	Web Container : If server is a type of web server which contains only one type of container ie web container. 
	Web container is responsible to execute servlet and jsp application. 
	Example of web server is tomcat. 

	Ejb Container : If server is type of application server which contains two type of container one is web container responsible to execute servlet and jsp. Second ejb container responsible to execute ejb application. 
	As well as application server provide extra services like connection pooling, thread managmenet, 
	resource management, security etc. 
	Example of application server is : WebLogic, JBoss, Glashfish etc. 
	
	HTML/HTML5+CSS/CSS3+JavaScript + Servlet/JSP/EJB or Spring framework (Spring boot)

	Web Service :

	req(https)				java(req)
Client 			HDFC 		XML/JSON	HSBC or SBI 
	res(https)		JEE/Spring boot 	.net(res)		asp.net or php or python or node js 	
	
	Java : Java is pure object and platform independent programming language but language dependent. 

	Web Service : Giving the Service for web application when both application running using 
	same/diffirent technologies may be same/different OS. 

	Web Service is platform independent as well as language independent as well as browser independent. 

	2 types 
	1. SOAP base web service : It is standard web web service which is base upon the SOA (Service Oriented 
	Architecture). XML

	XML : eXtensible Markup Language : Xml is use to hold the data or transfer the data or carry the data 
	from one application to another application. 
	
	SOAP : Simple Object Access Protocol. 
				Data must be only in the form of XML. 
				And xml is very heavy format. 
	2. RestFull Web Service : It is use to expose your resource that servlet/jsp as web service. 
	Data may be in form like xml or json or plain text or media type etc. 
	It is light weighted. 

	JSON : JavaScript Object Notation . It is like a map in Java. 
	RestFull web service using HTTP/https protocol 
		
	JAX_RS : Java API for XML RestFull Web Service 
			Using jersey tool 
			Using any other tools 

	Spring boot : We can develop RestFull Web Service 

	http protocol methods 
			CRUD Operation (Create/Read/Update/Delete)
	get() : Get the Resources (select query) with where clause 
	post() : Create Resources (insert query) 
	put() : Update Resoruces(update query)
	delete() : Delete Resources (delete query)

	HTML/HTML5

	Hypertext markup language :It is use to create the web pages. The pages may be static or dynamic web page. 
	HTML provided lot of pre-defined tags or elements. 

	syntax for tag 

	<tagName>	opening tag 

	</tagName>	closing tag 

	<tagName/>	self closing tag 

	html is not a case sensitive. 

	1. html tag 

	2. head 

	3. body 

	4. title tag 

	5. paragraph tag 

	<p>	</p>

	6. heading tag 
		6 types 

		h1 	largest 

		h6	smallest 

	7. break tag 
	
	8. Attribute : Properties of a tags. Attribute always we have to use in opening tag in the form of name-value 
	pairs 
	
	syntax 

	<tagName name1="value1" name2='value2' name3=value3>		</tagName>

	value my be in single quote or double quote or without quote no problem.
	but if value contains more than one world then it must be single or double quote. 

	In XML value must be single or double quote mandatory. 

	9. font tag : This tag is use to change the color, style and size of font. 

	10. hyperlink :

	<a href="pageName.html">Text</a>

	a ---> anchor 
	href---> hyperreference 

	11. Image tag 

	<img src="NameOfImage.jpeg/jpg/gif/bmt/png"/>

	12. List tags 

		a. Unorder list 
		b. Order list 
		c. Definition List 

	13. Table Tags 

	         Employee Details 

	EmpId	Name	Salary 
	100	Ravi	12000
	101	Ramesh	14000
	102	Rajesh	16000

		
	14. Forms tag 

	Login Page 

	html forms upto 4 version 

	<input type="text/password/radio/checkbox/button/submit/reset/file"/>
	

	<html>
	<head>
		<title>This is my web page</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h2>Login Page</h2>
		<form action="demo.html" method="post">
		<label>UserName:</label>
		<input type="text" name="uname"/><br/>
		<label>Password:</label>
		<input type="password" name="pname"/><br/>
		<input type="button" value="Sign In!"/>
			<input type="submit" value="Sign In!"/>
		<input type="reset" value="Clear Data!"/>
		<input type="button" value="Reset"/>
		</form>
	</body>
</html>

	Till HTML5 forms support only two methods get or post. It doesn't support put and delete methods. 

	If we want to call put or delete methods then we have to use 
	AJAX, RestClient using Java, Asp.net or Python, Angular / React JS

	To recieve the value from forms 

	1. Servlet
	2. JSP 
	3. JavaScript 
	4. RestFull Web Service
